Problem Statement : https://codu.ai/coding-problem/the%20ledger%20co

Hi there, this assignment is ready to submit.
However if you want to test it locally and you need to do some changes in LedgeApplication.java located at src/main/java/com/geektrust/LedgerApplication.java. 

The changes are as follows :- 
```
1. Create file named as test.txt at location geektrust/src/main/java/test.txt and put the test case which you want to test.
2. In LedgeApplication.java comment line 13  -> //String filePath = args[0];
   and at place of it paste this -> String filePath = "geektrust/src/main/java/test.txt"; 
```

In this way you can test this assignment at given test cases of above problem statement.

Remember to undo above changes if you submit it on geektrust.
